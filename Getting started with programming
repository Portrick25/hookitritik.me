In everyday life we listen how the applications and projects ar being developed using different programming language
many of students do different programming language , but we don't notice one thing that what programming actually is
for knowing about programming language we need to understand program and language saperately.
language:-A languge is way through which one object(person,animal,machine) communicate with another object.
technically, In term of computer science a language is way to give instruction to computer which it can understand.
But wait, we all knows that we give instructions to the computer in english language but computer doesn't understand
the english language ,it only understand binary language.
than how does it understand the language we tell it and perform the task according to us.
Now here comes the concept of programming.
we make a translator which is been programmed(instructions are written to perform a specific task)to which it convers our language into binary and binary language into ours.
so before learning the program we knew about what programming actually is.
example of programing language:-
C,C++,C#,java,kotlin,python, ruby etc.
